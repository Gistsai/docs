<Check>Great job! We're almost done with the essentials.</Check>

Now you've created some [gists](/essentials/gists), added [test cases](/essentials/test-cases), and knew about [evaluators](/essentials/evaluators), we're ready to run benchmarks to calculate the success rates of the gists.

## How it works

- Click on the `benchmark` button on the gist variant page
- Select all the variants you want to benchmark
- Select evaluators you want to enable that are applicable to your gist
- Select test cases that you want to run
- Choose how many times you want to run the test cases
- Click on `Run`

<Tip>It can take a few minutes to finishing running and evaluating all the test cases against your variants.</Tip>

<Warning>Gists calls OpenAI while running the benchmarks which will use your API quota.</Warning>
