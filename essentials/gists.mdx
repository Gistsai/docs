title: 'Gists'
---

A gist is a prompt template that is designed to accomplish a repetitive task.

## Example

Let's take a look at how gists are helpful.

Many people use ChatGPT to draft emails with prompts like this:
```text
Write an email draft:
- Greet them
- Ask about the progress of project
- Mention that it's been late for 1 week
- Let them know that we can help and wish for some update

Be succinct, direct, but polite.
```

This prompt consists of two parts: the `instruction` part and the `content` part.

<Expandable title="Instruction">
```text
Write an email draft:
{{content}}

Be succinct, direct, but polite.
```
</Expandable>
<Expandable title="Content">
```text
- Greet them
- Ask about the progress of project
- Mention that it's been late for 1 week
- Let them know that we can help and wish for some update
```
</Expandable>

While the contents can change case by case, the instructions for the tasks are highly reusable. 

In the above example, we've just created our first gist by placing a placeholder `{{content}}` in the prompt template.

By saving this gist with a name, such as `email-draft`, next time we want to create an email draft, we can just type the outline and provide it to the gist.
