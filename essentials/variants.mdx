Gists makes it easy to manage multiple versions of prompts called variants.

You can assign a unique name called slug for each variant.

We don't automatically create new versions of prompts for every edit, which gives you the freedom to manage variants the way you want.

## Examples

For example, one way to manage gist variants is by naming your variants like `dev` and `prod`.

You can edit `dev` variants without worrying that it'll break the user experience. When you're ready to ship it to the customers, you can:
- assign 100% of the traffic to `dev`
- rename the current `prod` variant to another name. e.g `prod-2023-10-13`
- rename the current `dev` variant to `prod`

Another way to manage gist variants is by splitting the traffic between them, so you can A/B test performance of different prompts or LLM parameters such as temperature and topP values.
