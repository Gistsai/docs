## Why do you need prompt management?

Prompts are the new source codes.

Source codes are key intellectual properties at tech companies. Software engineers are hired to create automated systems that solves business problems.

Now, with the emergence of Language Model models (LLMs), the power to automate tasks has expanded to include anyone who can document business operations in the form of prompts.

For companies aiming to enhance their competitive advantage, adopting a prompt management system will help them utilize LLMs to boost operational efficiency at a faster pace.

- Lack of prompt consistency evaluation
- Not sharable with the team
- Hard to compare prompt performance to pick better ones
