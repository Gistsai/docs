LLMs make it possible for everyone to harness their power and automate tasks.

In the tech world, source codes are highly valued for their ability to automate tasks and save time.

In the past, learning a programming language was necessary to automate tasks with computers, but this requirement no longer exists thanks to LLMs.

Now, anyone can automate tasks by creating prompts and integrating them into their workflows using NoCode tools.

Looking ahead, prompts will become the new source codes, and proactive companies will take measures to protect and manage them as valuable intellectual properties.
