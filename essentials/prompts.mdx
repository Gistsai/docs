LLMs, or Language Model Machines, have the potential to revolutionize task automation for everyone.

Source codes have always held immense value for tech companies due to their ability to streamline tasks and increase efficiency.

In the past, learning a programming language was a prerequisite to automating tasks using computers, and this often proved to be a challenging endeavor.

However, with the emergence of LLMs such as GPT-2, the need for coding expertise has diminished. Now, anyone can automate tasks by simply formulating prompts and seamlessly integrating them into their workflows using NoCode tools.

In the near future, prompts will assume the role that source codes once held, and progressive companies will recognize their significance as valuable intellectual properties that require protection and management.
