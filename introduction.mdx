### What is Gists
Gists is the first product that allows you to write, test, and evaluate prompts within one web app.

### Who is Gists for?
Gists is designed for non-technical employees who are eager to leverage the full power of LLMs. üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüöÄ

### Why are we helping non-programmers?
We believe the true value of LLMs comes from allowing anyone to teach the computers how to accomplish well-defined tasks, so they can automate the part of their jobs that are mundane and repetitive.

### What problems are we solving?
To automate tasks at scale with LLMs, non-programmers are missing some critical tools:
<ul>
    <li>‚úÖ Manage reusable prompts for individual tasks</li>
    <li>‚úÖ Integrate LLMs into workflow apps like Zapier and ServiceNow</li>
    <li>‚úÖ Evaluate prompt consistency when changing prompts</li>
    <li>‚úÖ Ensure safety and responsible LLM outputs to protect company reputation and brands</li>
</ul>

### What does the name mean?
Gist stands for the core message of some text. LLMs make it really cheap to generate long text. But any wise person knows that long text doesn't necessarily mean better communication, which is why we also use LLMs to summarize long texts back into the gists. Gists helps us communicate our intention and ideas more effectively.
